      <p>Maybe you&rsquo;re a novelist living in Paris, about to spend a day people watching in a caf&eacute;. Maybe you&rsquo;re living the same life you&rsquo;re living now, except you meditate every morning, exercise every evening and have a deeper connection with your family.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s where I come in. As a Female Empowerment Coach and Holistic Personal Trainer, I can help you gain confidence, clarity and help you tap into your innate power.&nbsp;</p>
