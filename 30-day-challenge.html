      <p>Now, don&rsquo;t allow any restrictions to influence this fantasy. Or fear of failure. This is an exercise in dreaming BIG.</p>
      <p>Where are you? Who are you with? What are you doing?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Maybe you&rsquo;re a novelist living in Paris, about to spend a day people watching in a caf&eacute;. Maybe you&rsquo;re living the same life you&rsquo;re living now, except you meditate every morning, exercise every evening and have a deeper connection with your family.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We all have things we want in life but are too embarrassed to admit. Or maybe you just wonder if there&rsquo;s more to life than this.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s where I come in. As a Female Empowerment Coach and Holistic Personal Trainer, I can help you gain confidence, clarity and help you tap into your innate power.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Or if you&rsquo;re less into the &ldquo;woo-woo&rdquo; stuff &ndash; I help women kick ass and kick goals &ndash; from helping them land their dream job to radically transforming their health and fitness. When you have the right support and the right tools, you can have it all.</p>

      <p>Having your own personal coach can help you figure out what&rsquo;s truly important to you, help you stay on track, remove emotional roadblocks and find the confidence and energy you need to make real, positive change in your life.</p>
