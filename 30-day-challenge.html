      <h3>Meet Carolina</h3>
      <p>For most of my life I felt not enough<br />Not pretty enough<br />Not slim enough<br />Not attractive enough<br /><br />I battled anxiety and eating disorders for many, many years.<br />I would punish my body for not being like the ones in the magazines. I would workout for hours and eat next to nothing all day only to feel in control of myself. Then, I&rsquo;d secretly binge-eat on chocolate, sweets and chips, numb myself for hours staring at the screen and hate myself about it. Through this unhealthy process I got to weigh 45 kilos and I still wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
      <p>As I became thinner than ever and I was still feeling like sh*t, I thought "well, maybe i should just quit this hard lifestyle and just relax".</p>
      <p>For the next couple of years I tried to live a "normal" life. I moved countries and I got married to an amazing man, started a successful business and created a beautiful community of friends...and guess what? I still didn't feel fully happy: I gained 15 kilos, experienced mood swings everyday, I stopped exercising and I was perpetually tired and feeling like I had no energy. I was always seeking a quick fix through coffee, a glass (or three) of wine, sugary snacks and trying different "healthy &amp; clean" eating approaches to make myself feel better.<br />It got to a point where my self confidence and self esteem were so low that I knew deep down to my core it was time to make a massive shift in my life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6_sm-12">
      <img class="editable" src="/uploads/coconut-carolina.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" />
    </div>
    <div class="col-6_sm-12-middle editable">
      <p><strong></strong><br />That&rsquo;s when my self love journey started, when I started to truly seeing my patterns and decided to make a change!<br />I booked a one way trip to Bali and immersed fully in a self discovery journey. I spent the next couple of years attending workshops, retreats and personal development courses, working with coaches and mentors and teaching along the way as I learnt more and more tools about self love.<br />I passionately committed to learn to love myself!<br /><br />Today I can look myself in the mirror and honestly say: "I love myself". I learnt to love my wrinkles, my cellulite, my jiggly bits and my chunky legs. I learnt to love my stretch-marks covered body, my ageing face and my frizzy hair.<br /><br />These days it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore if I gain or lose 3 kilos or what's going on in my life: I'm fiercely committed to love myself no matter what, make myself a priority everyday and do what makes me feel healthy, empowered, vibrant and sexy AF.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>The change wasn't easy but it started with a decision: the decision to live a life that I was proud of!&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong>Through this radical lifestyle change, today I sit naturally and effortlessly in a weight that I feel comfortable in, I have the motivation and discipline to make healthy food choices and have finally found the way to have an exercise routine that energises me and makes me look forward to the next workout!</p>
      <p>Now, I want to share this with women from all over the world...</p>
      <p>Since 2010, as a qualified Personal Trainer, Pilates and Pre &amp; Post Natal Fitness Instructor, Yoga &amp; Meditation facilitator and Dance teacher, I've helped thousand of women in Australia and Chile to lose weight and get fitter, but I knew there was a missing piece: I wanted to support women to feel EPIC, BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY and HAPPY no matter what!</p>
      <p>Today, my biggest wish is to help other women along this journey so they can also feel empowered, love the skin they live in and learn to take care of their bodies and hearts everyday and share the gift of being a woman in love with her whole self with their friends, daughters, sisters and the world!</p>
      <p>All my love,</p>
      <p>- Carolina</p>
      <p>XOX</p>
