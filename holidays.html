    <h2><strong><strong><strong>It's time to own your worth, darling!</strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </h2>
    <h4><strong><strong>End 2019 activating</strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;that confident, </strong></h4>
    <h4><strong>empowered, joyful, sexy YOU!</strong></h4>
    <p>We have 4 weeks left of this year, which also marks the end of the decade.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The calendar year is coming to an end and you see yourself being pulled in different directions at the same time: family, partner, friends, work, career, kids&hellip;...you show up for everyone, but what about you?</p>
    <p>Christmas, New Year and the holiday seasons are by excellence a time of high stress and anxiety due to the demands of gift-giving and family gatherings. Having to spend time with family members that push your buttons and disrespect you, travelling back to your hometown and having to see an ex or a friend that triggers you, or simply wrapping up the year and realizing that you&rsquo;re kinda in the same place than at the beginning of 2019:</p>
    <p>Toxic relationships, co-dependent dynamics, lingering heartbreak, low self-esteem, lack of confidence to follow your dreams, emotional exhaustion, burnout, over-giving or financial stress&hellip;.</p>
    <p>How can we start the new year (and the new decade) on a clean slate if we are carrying so much past baggage?</p>
    <p>My invitation: Invest in yourself, take some radical action towards your self-care, mentally, emotionally and physically.</p>
    <p>Gift yourself the opportunity of doing things differently this time and be supported the way you've always craved, so you can not only survive the holidays, but also plant the seeds to the best possible new year....because you're worth it!</p>

        <p>"Carolina helped me to start loving myself, I think for the first time in my life. I have been able to access some very deep emotional hurt and transform the stories of my life. Carolina has helped me to be embodied in my own life and accept who I am and where I am at in the present. I have learnt to be 100% ok about listening to my own intuition and how to set clear boundaries and say no. I feel I have come in contact with my authentic self and have come to a place of loving acceptance of who I am. I loved how Carolina held the space so gracefully in which I could pour out and heal. I never imagined this was possible online."</p>

        <p>"I started working with Carolina to help overcome some disordered eating issues and she&rsquo;s been absolutely life changing! I can confidently say that Carolina is helping me change my mindset, my goals and the ways I think and feel about my body. She has managed to help me break down my protective walls when it comes to my challenges and I&rsquo;m so excited to see how far I come in the next months of working with her!"</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The 3 months program with Carolina has been, by far, the best investment I've made this year. With Carolina&rsquo;s loving guidance and support I managed to navigate a very challenging time in my life. I thought that a change of careers, divorce, financial instability, being out of shape, etc., were the cause of my anxiety, but Carolina has helped me realise it was a lack of self-esteem. Now I&rsquo;m finally seeing my worth and learning to love myself everyday. I started my own business, decided to move cities and I haven&rsquo;t felt this excited about life in a long time! PS: And I love her sexy chilean accent&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo; I recently had my first &lsquo;deep dive coaching&rsquo; call with Carolina. Not only is she a warm, beautiful, gentle soul whom is easy to talk too. She is also very inspiring and helps you dig deep within yourself to reach your full potential. Her follow-up on me after the call, helped me to stay on track and to keep on shining and doing the work. Gracias bella!"</p>

      <h2>Hi there, I'm Carolina&nbsp;</h2>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>For most of my life, I felt not enough</p>
      <p>Not pretty enough</p>
      <p>Not slim enough</p>
      <p>Not attractive enough</p>
      <p>Just not good enough</p>
      <p>I battled anxiety and eating disorders for many, many years. I would punish my body for not being like the ones in the magazines. I would workout for hours and eat next to nothing all day only to feel in control of myself. Through this unhealthy process, I got to weigh 45 kilos...but I still wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
      <p>As I became thinner than ever and I was still feeling like sh*t, I thought, "well, maybe I should just quit trying to fit the norm and just relax." I timidly started the process of learning to love myself by studying everything about nutrition, meditation and holistic wellness and took a vow of sharing my lessons with other women along the journey.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>For the next 10 years, I followed what was expected of me. I got married to an amazing man, moved countries, built a successful business in the fitness industry and created a beautiful community of friends: "My life is perfect, I finally love myself!"&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>I didn't know yet, but my self-love was still built on external factors</strong>...and a series of events came to shake it all up! Out of fear, disconnection to myself, and lack of self-worth and self-awareness, I chose to put my life on hold and myself on the back burner to follow the man to a different country (because that&rsquo;s what a good wife&rsquo;s supposed to do!, no?), despite knowing that, deep down, I wasn&rsquo;t listening to my truth. In the process, I gave up my business, my financial independence, and my self-confidence. I spiralled into a horrible depression, started suffering from severe anxiety, gained 12 kilos through emotional eating, and felt totally miserable for many, many months.</p>
      <p><strong>Enter Bali...&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>In an attempt to get my head out of the waters and following my passion for Yoga, I enrolled in a Teacher Training that would catalyse an awakening process. After several months of back and forth, I took the heartbreaking decision to end my marriage and leave the comforts of a 10+ years relationship that wasn't aligned with my path anymore. I needed to know who I was, but more importantly:&nbsp;<strong>Could I truly love myself with nothing external to prove my worth?</strong></p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s when my self-love journey truly started: when I devotedly committed to explore and hold space for all parts of myself, especially the not-so-pretty ones. I lifted the carpet where I'd hidden my BS for decades and, oh darling, there was a lot of it! Unhealthy patterns, old trauma, victim stories, co-dependancy and lots of excuses masked as perfectionism.</p>
      <p>I spent the next couple of years attending workshops, retreats and personal development courses, studying, researching and breathing every day into my quest of becoming the woman I want to be. I hired coaches and mentors and continued teaching along the way as I learnt more and more tools about self-love.</p>
      <p><strong>Today I can look myself in the mirror and honestly say: "I love myself."</strong>&nbsp;I learnt to love my wrinkles, my cellulite, my jiggly bits and my chunky legs. I learnt to accept all my emotions (not just the "good" ones), to speak my truth even if my voice shakes, to be OK with not having my sh*t together all the time. I learnt to fill my own cup first, to draw healthy boundaries and say no when I need to without guilt or shame. I learnt that cultivating forgiveness and compassion towards myself and others is way better than living in paralyzing and soul-destroying perfectionism as I used to.</p>
      <p>The change hasn't been easy, but it started with the decision to create a life that I actually loved...and I believe that loving ourselves is our birthright!</p>
      <p>Since 2009, as a qualified Personal Trainer, Pilates, Dance, Yoga &amp; Meditation facilitator, and Women's Coach, I've helped thousands of women to become fitter and healthier inside and out, own their worth, build up their self-esteem and self-confidence.</p>
      <p><strong>My passion in life is to support women to feel EPIC, BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY, SEXY and HAPPY&hellip;. to love themselves FULLY no matter what!</strong></p>
      <p>My biggest dream is to live in a world where we all feel empowered, worthy, confident and walking our truth by taking care of our bodies, minds and hearts every day.</p>
      <p>In a society that profits from our self-doubt and controls us with incessant messages about how we need to be different than who we are,&nbsp;<strong>I firmly believe we can change the world by simply being a woman in love with her whole Self.</strong></p>
      <p>Phewww! end of the novel!</p>
      <p>Sooooo much love, besos y abrazos! (kisses &amp; hugs)</p>
      <p>- Carolina</p>
