      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>This is a 7 days process to explore, learn and deepen into what Self Love truly is for you and how you can amplify it in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A deeply rewarding &nbsp;journey, fluff free, designed to guide you to know and love yourself better through self-inquiry and introspection, supported by a committed group of epic women and the undivided attention and thought provoking insights from your coach (me!).</p>
      <p>My purpose is to empower you to build up self confidence, make peace with your body, transform the negative self talk, learn to take better care of yourself, re-frame your insecurities, become best friends with your strengths &amp; weaknesses, own your power, your unique beauty and get back that zest for life.</p>
      <p>If you've ever wanted to fly to Bali and go on a transformational retreat, this is your chance to get access to the same deep work and healing modalities I teach on retreats and teacher trainings, and you'll get to do it at home at an affordable price...the only thing that takes is saying YES to yourself and to love yourself more</p>
      <p>Let's go all in!</p>

      <p><strong></strong><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-8_sm-12 editable">
      <p>For most of my life I felt not enough</p>
      <p>Not pretty enough</p>
      <p>Not slim enough</p>
      <p>Not attractive enough</p>
      <p>Not good enough</p>
      <p>I battled anxiety and eating disorders for many, many years.</p>
      <p>I would punish my body for not being like the ones in the magazines. I would workout for hours and eat next to nothing all day only to feel in control of myself. Through this unhealthy process I got to weigh 45 kilos...but I still wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
      <p>As I became thinner than ever and I was still feeling like sh*t, I thought "well, maybe i should just quit this hard lifestyle and just relax".</p>
      <p>For the next couple of years I tried to live a "normal" life. I moved countries and I got married to an amazing man, started a successful business and created a beautiful community of friends. For almost 8 years I was blissfully happy until a series of events changed my life forever. Out of fear, disconnection to myself, lack of self love and self-awareness I took a very disempowering decision: I decided to put my life on hold and myself in the back burner to follow the man to a different country (because that&rsquo;s what a wife&rsquo;s supposed to do!), despite sensing &nbsp;deep down that I wasn&rsquo;t listening to my inner wisdom. In that process I lost my business, my friends, my career, and my self-confidence. I spiralled into a horrible depression, started suffering severe anxiety, gained 15 kilos through emotional eating, and felt totally miserable.</p>
      <p>Enter Bali...</p>
      <p>Following my passion for Yoga I enrolled in a Teacher Training that would be the catalyst to an awakening process. I took the heartbreaking decision to end my marriage and leave the security, comfort and familiarity of a 10+ years relationship that wasn&rsquo;t in alignment with my path anymore. I wanted to know who I was and what was my mission in this life.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s when my self love journey started, when I passionately committed to discover and hold space for all parts of myself. I started to truly see my unhealthy patterns, to heal old trauma and to unfold all the victim stories that didn&rsquo;t serve me and decided to make a change!</p>
      <p>I immersed fully in a self discovery mission. I spent the next couple of years attending workshops, retreats and personal development courses, studying, researching and breathing everyday into my quest for becoming the woman I want to be. I worked with coaches and mentors and continued teaching along the way as I learnt more and more tools about self love.</p>
      <p>Today I can look myself in the mirror and honestly say: "I love myself". I learnt to love my wrinkles, my cellulite, my jiggly bits and my chunky legs. I learnt to love my stretch-marks covered body, my ageing face and my frizzy hair. I accept all my emotions, I&rsquo;ve learnt to draw healthy boundaries, I can deal with making mistakes, I&rsquo;ve learnt to forgive myself and to be more compassionate with myself and others, instead of living in paralyzing perfectionism as I used to.</p>
      <p>These days I'm fiercely committed to loving myself no matter what, follow my own path, make myself a priority everyday and do more of what makes me feel healthy, empowered, vibrant and sexy AF.</p>
      <p>The change wasn't easy but it started with a decision: the decision to live a life that I was proud of!</p>
      <p>Now, I want to share this with women from all over the world&hellip;</p>
      <p>Since 2010, as a qualified Personal Trainer, Pilates and Pre &amp; Post Natal Fitness Instructor, Yoga &amp; Meditation facilitator, Dance teacher and Women's Coach, I've helped thousand of women in Australia and Chile to become fitter and healthier inside and out, &nbsp;build up their self esteem and self confidence.</p>
      <p>And today, my passion in life is to support women to feel EPIC, BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY, SEXY and HAPPY&hellip;. to love themselves FULLY no matter what!</p>
      <p>My biggest wish is to guide other women on this journey so they can also feel empowered, worthy, confident and learn to take care of their bodies and hearts everyday. I believe we can change the world by simply being a woman in love with her whole Self and by sharing this precious gift with the world!</p>
      <p>Sooooo much love,</p>
      <p>- Carolina</p>
      <p>XOX</p>
