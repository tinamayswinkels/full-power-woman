      <p><strong></strong><br />That&rsquo;s when my self love journey started, when I started to truly seeing my patterns and decided to make a change!<br />I booked a one way trip to Bali and immersed fully in a self discovery journey. I spent the next couple of years attending workshops, retreats and personal development courses, working with coaches and mentors and teaching along the way as I learnt more and more tools about self love.<br />I passionately committed to learn to love myself!<br /><br />Today I can look myself in the mirror and honestly say: "I love myself". I learnt to love my wrinkles, my cellulite, my jiggly bits and my chunky legs. I learnt to love my stretch-marks covered body, my ageing face and my frizzy hair.<br /><br />These days it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore if I gain or lose 3 kilos or what's happening in my life: I'm fiercely committed to love myself no matter what, make myself a priority everyday and do more of what makes me feel healthy, empowered, vibrant and sexy AF.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
